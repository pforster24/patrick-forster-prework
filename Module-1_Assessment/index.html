        <p> My name is Patrick Forster, welcome to the first website that I have ever built!
          I am currently a senior at the University of Virginia studying both economics and Media Studies.
          Through these classes I have been exposed to a wide variety of subjects and materials, but none of my classes have
          ever prepared me to code before. <br><br>
          The Dev10 coding bootcamp is the first exposure that I have ever had to real coding, and I am loving the experience! 
          Although frustrating at times, coding is an extremely rewarding task, with results that materialize reight before your eyes!
          I feel as though I am learning extremely quickly, and will be able to tackle even large projects in the near future! <br><br>
          In my free time I enjoy playing video games, tinkering with computers, and spending time outside with friends and family.
          I also know how to play the piano, and try to practice regualrly to keep up on my skills. I was also lucky enough to be taught spanish
          over the course of my undergraduate career, so I try my best to read and write things in Spanish regularly to make sure that 
          I don't lose that skills either. <br><br>
          On the whole, I think that I am a pretty fun person to be around, and if you know me, you definitely know that I love learning
          new things. Because of this, I look at learning to code as a new adventure to take, and I am looking forward to taking the next steps down this path in the near future.
